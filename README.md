- **Workspace IDE**: JupyterLab
- **Environment**: LendingClubProject (default)
- **Hardware Tier**: Small (default)

Click **Launch**.

**You've launched your workspace!**

---

## Lab 2.3 — Exploratory Data Analysis

Open `notebooks/EDA_lending.ipynb` from the file browser.

In the **Data** panel on the left, navigate to **Data Sources** and find the LendingClubWorkshop source. Copy the Python connection snippet into the first cell of the notebook and run it.

Work through the notebook cell by cell. The notebook will:

1. Load raw loan data from S3
2. Inspect missing values and data quality
3. Explore the target variable — default rate by loan grade, purpose, and home ownership
4. Plot feature distributions split by defaulted vs fully paid loans
5. Run a correlation heatmap to identify key predictors
6. Run the preprocessing pipeline (`scripts/preprocess.py`)
7. Verify engineered features and write the cleaned dataset to your Domino Dataset

Key insights to note as you run through the notebook:

- The default rate is approximately 20–25% across resolved loans — a moderately imbalanced classification problem
- **Interest rate** and **grade** are the strongest predictors — Grade E/F/G loans default significantly more
- **DTI** shows clear separation between defaulted and fully paid loans
- Engineered features (`loan_to_income`, `credit_utilization`) add meaningful signal

Rename the notebook `EDA_lending.ipynb` when complete.

**You've successfully explored the loan dataset!**

---

## Lab 2.4 — Sync Files

***Documentation: [Sync changes in a Workspace](https://docs.dominodatalab.com/en/latest/user_guide/262fef/sync-changes-in-a-workspace/)***

Click the **File Changes** tab in the top left corner of your workspace. Enter a commit message such as *"EDA notebook complete"* and click **Sync All Changes**.

Click **Stop** to stop the workspace instance.

**You've synced your changes!**

---

## Lab 2.5 — Complete Project Tasks

Navigate to **Code** in your project. Click on `EDA_lending.ipynb` and select **Link to Task**. Choose the *Explore Loan Data* task.

Navigate back to **Tasks**, open *Explore Loan Data*, and mark it as complete.

**You've completed your first project task!**

---

## Lab 2.6 — Train Models with Domino Jobs

***Documentation: [Run a Job](https://docs.dominodatalab.com/en/latest/user_guide/af97b7/create-and-run-jobs/)***

Navigate to **Jobs** in your project and click **Run**.

Inspect `scripts/multitrain.py` in the Code browser first — it orchestrates three parallel training jobs:

- `scripts/train_sklearn.py` — Random Forest classifier with balanced class weights
- `scripts/train_xgboost.py` — XGBoost with `scale_pos_weight` for class imbalance
- `scripts/train_h2o.py` — H2O AutoML with up to 15 models

In the **File Name or Command** field enter:

```
scripts/multitrain.py
```

Click **Start**. Watch as three job runs appear. Click into the `train_xgboost.py` job run and inspect the **Results** tab once complete — you'll see confusion matrices and feature importance charts logged automatically.

**You've trained three credit risk models!**

---

## Lab 2.7 — Compare Experiments with MLflow

***Documentation: [Track and monitor experiments](https://docs.dominodatalab.com/en/latest/user_guide/da707d/track-and-monitor-experiments/)***

Navigate to **Experiments** in your project. Click on the **LendingClub-CreditRisk** experiment.

You'll see three runs — one per framework — each tagged with the framework name and logging four metrics: **AUC**, **F1**, **Precision**, and **Recall**.

Click **Edit** on the visualisation and add all four metrics to the chart so you can compare across frameworks at a glance.

Select all three runs using the checkboxes and click **Compare**. Review:

- Which framework achieves the highest AUC?
- How do precision and recall trade off across models?
- What are the top feature importances in each run?

The XGBoost model typically performs best on this dataset and will be used for deployment.

Link the best-performing run to the *Train Credit Risk Model* task and mark it as complete.

**You've compared experiments and selected your best model!**

---

# Section 3 — Deploy to Production

## Lab 3.1 — Deploy a Domino Endpoint

***Documentation: [Deploy Domino endpoints](https://docs.dominodatalab.com/en/latest/user_guide/8dbc91/deploy-domino-endpoints/)***

Navigate to **Deployments > Endpoints** and click **Create Domino endpoint**.

- **Name**: `lending-credit-risk-yourname`
- **Description**:
```
Credit risk scoring endpoint for LendingClub loan default prediction.

Sample scoring request:
{
  "data": {
    "loan_amnt": 15000,
    "int_rate": 13.5,
    "grade": "C",
    "annual_inc": 65000,
    "dti": 18.5,
    "home_ownership": "RENT",
    "purpose": "debt_consolidation",
    "term": "36"
  }
}
```
- **File**: `scripts/predict.py`
- **Function**: `predict`
- **Environment**: LendingClubProject
- Check **Log HTTP requests and responses to model instance logs**

Click **Create Endpoint**. The status will progress: Preparing → Building → Starting → Running (2–5 minutes).

**You've created a Domino scoring endpoint!**

---

## Lab 3.2 — Test the Endpoint

***Documentation: [Request Predictions](https://docs.dominodatalab.com/en/latest/user_guide/8dbc91/deploy-domino-endpoints/#Request-a-prediction)***

Once the endpoint is **Running**, navigate to the **Overview** tab and paste the sample request into the **Tester**:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "loan_amnt": 15000,
    "int_rate": 13.5,
    "grade": "C",
    "annual_inc": 65000,
    "dti": 18.5,
    "home_ownership": "RENT",
    "purpose": "debt_consolidation",
    "term": "36"
  }
}
```

The response will include:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `default_probability` | Model's predicted probability of default (0–1) |
| `risk_score` | Inverted score (100 = safest, 0 = riskiest) |
| `risk_tier` | Low / Medium / High |
| `recommendation` | Approve / Review / Decline |
| `shap_values` | Top 5 features driving the decision |

Try modifying `dti` from 18.5 to 45.0 and observe how the probability and recommendation change.

**You've tested your scoring endpoint!**

---

## Lab 3.3 — Deploy the Loan Officer Dashboard

***Documentation: [Publish Apps](https://docs.dominodatalab.com/en/latest/user_guide/71635d/publish-apps/)***

Before publishing the app, set the endpoint environment variables so the app can call your scoring API:

1. Navigate to your endpoint's **Overview** tab and copy the **Endpoint URL** and **API Key**
2. In your project, go to **Settings > Environment Variables** and add:
   - `DOMINO_MODEL_API_URL` — your endpoint URL
   - `DOMINO_MODEL_API_KEY` — your API key

Navigate to **Deployments > App**. Enter the title *YourName Loan Officer Dashboard* and click **Publish**.

Once active (1–3 minutes), click **View App**. You'll see:

- A loan application form on the left with inputs for all key features
- Four metric cards showing probability, risk score, risk tier, and recommendation
- A gauge chart visualising the default probability with green/amber/red bands
- A SHAP waterfall chart showing the top 5 decision drivers — red bars increase default risk, green bars decrease it
- A raw JSON response panel at the bottom

Enter some test applications and observe how the SHAP chart changes as you adjust features like `dti`, `grade`, and `annual_inc`.

**You've deployed a loan officer dashboard!**

---

## Lab 3.4 — Share the App

***Documentation: [App Security and Identity](https://docs.dominodatalab.com/en/latest/user_guide/cb9195/app-security-and-identity/)***

Navigate to the **Permissions** tab in your app. Update permissions to **Anyone, including anonymous users**.

Copy the app link from the **Settings** tab and open it in a private/incognito window. Confirm you can access the app without being logged into Domino.

Mark the *Deploy Scoring API* task as complete.

**You've shared your loan officer dashboard!**

---

# Section 4 — Model Monitoring

## Lab 4.1 — Set Up a Model Monitor

***Documentation: [Domino Model Monitor](https://docs.dominodatalab.com/en/latest/user_guide/model-monitor/)***

Navigate to **Deployments > Model Monitor** and click **Set Up Monitor** on your endpoint.

Configure the monitor using the settings in `monitoring/drift_config.yaml`:

- **Prediction type**: Classification
- **Target column**: `is_default`
- **Positive class**: 1

Upload `monitoring/baseline_stats.json` as the baseline dataset (generated in the next lab).

---

## Lab 4.2 — Generate a Baseline and Define Drift Metrics

Run the baseline script as a Domino Job:

```
scripts/monitoring_baseline.py --mode baseline
```

Once complete, inspect the **Results** tab — you'll see the baseline feature distribution plots. These represent the "normal" state of incoming loan applications.

Back in Model Monitor, configure drift alerts for the following features using PSI thresholds:

| Feature | Priority | Alert at PSI | Retrain at PSI |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dti` | High | 0.10 | 0.20 |
| `int_rate` | High | 0.10 | 0.20 |
| `annual_inc` | High | 0.10 | 0.20 |
| `loan_to_income` | High | 0.10 | 0.20 |
| `revol_util` | Medium | 0.10 | 0.20 |

**You've configured drift monitoring!**

---

## Lab 4.3 — Simulate Drift

Run the drift simulation job to see alerts in action:

```
scripts/monitoring_baseline.py --mode simulate --shift-severity medium
```

Inspect the **Results** tab — you'll see a PSI bar chart colour-coded green/amber/red. Features above 0.2 PSI are flagged for retraining.

Navigate back to **Model Monitor** and observe the drift alerts that have been triggered. Discuss with your instructor: what real-world events might cause this kind of shift in loan application data?

**You've observed model drift in action!**

---

## Lab 4.4 — Trigger Retraining

From the Model Monitor alert view, click **Trigger Retraining** and select `scripts/multitrain.py` as the retraining job.

Once the job completes, navigate to **Experiments** and compare the new run against the previous baseline. Has the model performance changed?

**You've triggered a model retraining from a drift alert!**

---

# Section 5 — Domino Flows

## Lab 5.1 — Introduction to Domino Flows

***Documentation: [Domino Flows](https://docs.dominodatalab.com/en/latest/user_guide/flows/)***

Navigate to **Flows** in the left pane. Flows lets you define DAG-based pipelines that orchestrate multiple jobs with dependencies, conditional branching, and scheduling.

Review the pipeline DAG for this workshop:

```
[Ingest from S3] → [Preprocess] → [Train sklearn ]
                                → [Train XGBoost ] → [Evaluate AUC]
                                → [Train H2O     ]       ↓
                                              AUC > 0.80 → [Promote Endpoint]
                                              AUC ≤ 0.80 → [Alert & Hold]
```

Note that the three training steps run **in parallel** after preprocessing — Domino handles this automatically based on the `depends_on` configuration.

---

## Lab 5.2 — Build the Retraining Flow

Click **New Flow** and select **Import YAML**. Upload `flows/retraining_flow.yaml`.

Review each step in the Flow editor:
- **ingest** → **preprocess**: sequential dependency
- **train_sklearn**, **train_xgboost**, **train_h2o**: all depend on preprocess, run in parallel
- **evaluate**: depends on all three training steps
- **promote** / **alert_hold**: conditional branches based on `outputs.evaluate.auc`

Update the `project` field in the YAML to match your project name before importing.

**You've defined a retraining pipeline as code!**

---

## Lab 5.3 — Run and Monitor the Flow

Click **Run Flow**. Observe the DAG view as each step executes — you'll see the parallel training steps run simultaneously and the conditional branch fire once evaluate completes.

Click into individual steps to inspect their logs and outputs in real time.

**You've run a full ML retraining pipeline!**

---

## Lab 5.4 — Schedule the Flow

In the Flow editor, click **Schedule**. Set a monthly schedule (1st of each month at 06:00 UTC).

This represents production-ready continuous retraining — the pipeline will automatically ingest fresh data, retrain, evaluate, and only promote if quality thresholds are met.

**You've scheduled a recurring retraining pipeline!**

---

# Section 6 — GenAI & Agentic Systems

## Lab 6.1 — Introduction to GenAI in Domino 6.2

***Documentation: [GenAI in Domino](https://docs.dominodatalab.com/en/latest/user_guide/genai/)***

Domino 6.2 introduces native support for LLM integration, RAG pipelines, and agentic patterns. In this section you'll build a system that explains the credit model's decisions to loan officers in plain English — combining the ML model, SHAP values, and an LLM with access to company lending policy documents.

Review `genai/loan_explainer_agent.py`. The agent has two tools:

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `score_loan` | Calls your Domino scoring endpoint to get default probability and SHAP values |
| `retrieve_policy` | Retrieves relevant policy documents based on the top SHAP risk factors |

---

## Lab 6.2 — Run the Loan Decision Explainer

Launch a workspace and open a terminal. Set your API key:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here
export DOMINO_MODEL_API_URL=your-endpoint-url
export DOMINO_MODEL_API_KEY=your-endpoint-key
```

Run the explainer with the default sample application:

```bash
python genai/loan_explainer_agent.py
```

Observe the agent's step-by-step reasoning in the logs:
1. It calls `score_loan` to get the model prediction and SHAP values
2. It calls `retrieve_policy` with the top risk factor feature names
3. It generates a structured plain-English explanation citing policy

Try the interactive mode to test with custom inputs:

```bash
python genai/loan_explainer_agent.py --interactive
```

**You've built and run an agentic credit decision explainer!**

---

## Lab 6.3 — Explore RAG with Policy Documents

Navigate to `genai/policy_docs/`. These text files simulate the company's internal lending policy manual.

Open `debt_to_income_policy.txt` — note the tiered DTI thresholds and compensating factors. Now run the agent with a high-DTI application and observe how it retrieves and cites this document in its explanation.

Discuss with your instructor:
- How would you extend this to a proper vector database (e.g. Pinecone, pgvector)?
- What happens if the policy changes — how do you keep the agent in sync?

---

## Lab 6.4 — Integrate the Explainer into the Dashboard

The loan officer dashboard (`app/app.py`) is designed to accept the SHAP values returned by `predict.py`. The agent in `loan_explainer_agent.py` can be called directly from the app to add a natural-language explanation panel beneath the SHAP waterfall chart.

As a stretch exercise, modify `app/app.py` to add:

1. A **"Explain Decision"** button below the SHAP chart
2. A callback that calls `explain_loan_decision()` with the current loan inputs
3. A text panel that renders the agent's explanation using `dcc.Markdown`

This wires together the full stack: ML model → SHAP explainability → LLM explanation → loan officer UI.

**You've built a full GenAI-augmented credit decisioning system!**
